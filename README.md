My understanding on Open Sources

# Introduction
What exactly is an open source?
    Open source is a source code or a project that is freely available to make required modifications and redistribution i.e, anybody can study, use modify and distribute that project for any purpose. 

There are available open sources guides that help us learn the way open sources are made and everything related.

My learning is from the open source guide by Github.

# Why do I need to contribute?
   Contributing to an open source helps us improve our skills in a way where we can learn, teach and at the same time, build experience. There are many reasons as to why people contribute to open source. Some of them include to improve existing skills, meeting people with similar interests, finding mentors and teaching others.
   
# What does it mean to contribute?
   It is not alaways about contributing code, but it also includes contributing by organizing workshops, designing layouts for easy navigation through the project, improving the project's documentation. This helps us meet other community members and build relationships that give us opprtunities to work on other parts of the project.
